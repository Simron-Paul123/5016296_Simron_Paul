Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used to store a collection of elements in a sequential manner. 
Unlike arrays, elements in linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations. 
Instead, each element, called a node, contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Here are the main types of linked lists:

1. Singly Linked List
Structure: Each node has two parts: the data and a pointer to the next node in the list.
Traversal: Can be traversed in one direction—from the head (first node) to the end (last node).
Use Cases: Useful when you need a simple, dynamic data structure with efficient insertion and deletion operations at the front.
Example Structure: Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> ... -> NodeN -> null

2. Doubly Linked List
Structure: Each node contains three parts: the data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
Traversal: Can be traversed in both directions—from head to tail and vice versa.
Use Cases: Useful when bidirectional traversal is needed, or when it's necessary to efficiently delete nodes from both ends or the middle.
Example Structure: null <- Node1 <-> Node2 <-> Node3 <-> ... <-> NodeN -> null

3. Circular Linked List
Structure: Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
Traversal: Can traverse the entire list starting from any node, as there's no null end.
Use Cases: Useful in applications where the data is cyclic, like in a round-robin scheduler.
Example Structure: Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> ... -> NodeN -> Node1

4. Circular Doubly Linked List
Structure: A doubly linked list where the last node points back to the first node and the first node's previous pointer points to the last node.
Traversal: Allows traversal in both directions and can start from any node, looping through the list indefinitely.
Use Cases: Useful for applications like browser history where you might want to navigate forward and backward without bounds.
Example Structure: Node1 <-> Node2 <-> Node3 <-> ... <-> NodeN <-> Node1

5. Multi-linked List
Structure: Nodes contain multiple links, pointing to different lists or nodes.
Traversal: Traversal depends on the structure and purpose of the multiple links.
Use Cases: Used in complex data structures like adjacency lists in graph representations.
6. Skip List
Structure: A multi-level linked list where elements are linked at multiple levels, with the upper levels skipping over several elements.
Traversal: Efficiently traverses the list by skipping nodes, allowing for faster searches.
Use Cases: Useful for implementing ordered lists that allow for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations, often used in databases.
Each type of linked list has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, depending on the use case and the specific requirements of the application. For example, singly linked lists are simpler and use less memory, while doubly linked lists provide more flexibility for operations like deletion and reverse traversal. Circular linked lists are ideal for scenarios where the end of the list must connect back to the beginning, and skip lists offer fast search times for sorted data.




Analysis ( Analyze the time complexity of each operation.)
----------------------

Add Operation: O(1)
Search Operation: O(n)
Delete Operation: O(n)
Traverse Operation: O(n)

Advantages
-----------------------------------------
Linked lists are dynamic and can grow or shrink as needed. 
They are efficient for insertions and deletions but have slower access times compared to arrays.
