Understanding Recursive Algorithms
------------------------------------------

Recursion simplifies certain problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems. However, it can lead to excessive computation if not optimized.

Analysis
--------------------

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of years.

Optimization
------------------------
Use memoization to store intermediate results and avoid repeated calculations. This can reduce the time complexity to O(n).
