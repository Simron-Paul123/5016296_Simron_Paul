Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linear search:
----------------------
Also called sequential search, this algorithm compares each element in a list or array to the key being searched, 
one by one, until the target is found. It's best for smaller datasets and can work on both sorted and unsorted arrays. 
Linear search has a time complexity of O(n) and may require up to n comparisons, where n is the number of elements in the array.

Binary Search:
------------------------------
This algorithm is used to find a value in a sorted array by repeatedly halving the search interval. 
It compares the key to the middle element of the array, and if the middle element doesn't match, it eliminates half of the remaining search space. 
Binary search is more efficient than linear search, especially for large datasets, and has a time complexity of O(log n). It requires at most log2(n+1) comparisons


Analysis
------------------------------------

Linear Search: O(n) in the worst case.
Binary Search: O(log n) in the worst case, but requires sorted data.

Analysis
----------------------------
Linear Search: O(n)
Binary Search: O(log n)

Suitable Algorithm
----------------------------------
Binary search is more efficient but requires sorted data. Use binary search for large, sorted datasets and linear search for small or unsorted datasets.
