Exercise 1: Inventory Management System
Scenario: 
You are developing an inventory management system for a warehouse. Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial.
Steps:
1.	Understand the Problem:
    o	Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
    o	Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
2.  Analysis:
    o	Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
    o	Discuss how you can optimize these operations.

Explanation and Optimizations
Data Structure Choice:

HashMap is used to store products, where the product ID serves as the key. This provides average time complexities of O(1) for insert, delete, and lookup operations, making it efficient for managing large inventories.
Product Class:

Encapsulates product properties and ensures data consistency.
Inventory Class:

Centralized management of inventory operations like add, delete, update, and display.
Error Handling:

Simple error handling can be improved by adding checks for invalid inputs and non-existent products.
Time Complexity Analysis
Add Product: O(1)
Delete Product: O(1)
Update Product: O(1)
Display Inventory: O(n), where n is the number of products.
This optimization provides efficient management of the inventory system, making it scalable and performant for larger datasets.
