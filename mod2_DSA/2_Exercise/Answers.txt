Understanding Asymptotic Notation
--------------------------------------------------------
Big O Notation: Describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity, helping to understand its worst-case performance.
Linear Search: O(n) in the worst case.
Binary Search: O(log n) in the worst case, but requires sorted data.

Analysis
----------------------------
Linear Search: O(n)
Binary Search: O(log n)

Suitable Algorithm
----------------------------------
Binary search is more efficient but requires sorted data. Use binary search for large, sorted datasets and linear search for small or unsorted datasets.
