Memory Representation of Array
------------------------------------------------

Array is a linear data structure that is a collection of similar data types.
 Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations. It is a static data structure with a fixed size. It combines data of similar types.

Advantages
-----------------------
    1. Contiguous block of allocation -> easy to search through index
    2. Direct Memory allocation
    3. If we know how many elemnts we want to store then array has fixed size for that case no memory wastage





Analysis
---------------------------------------
Add Operation: O(1) if space is available, O(n) if resizing is needed.
Search Operation: O(n)
Delete Operation: O(n)
Traverse Operation: O(n)

Limitations
------------------------------------------------
Arrays have a fixed size, which can be limiting. Dynamic data structures like ArrayList or LinkedList can be more flexible.
